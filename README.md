# Comprehensive Coding Solutions

The objective of this repository is to contain all feasible solutions to programming problems. This includes not just the most optimal solution but also sub-optimal ones that help gain a better understanding or a new perspective on the problem approaches.

I make sure to include every feasible solution, and even if I skip any, I try to at least add a note about it. I also try to explain every solution in as much detail as I can with comments and docstrings; this is not just a simple code dump.

Currently most of the problems are from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), but I may add problems from other programming platforms in the future. Feel free to add solutions of your own, even from different platforms or programming languages.
