# Codiq

The objective of this repository is to contain all feasible solutions to programming problems. This includes not just the most optimal solution but also sub-optimal ones that help gain a better understanding or a new perspective on the problem approaches.

I make sure to include every feasible and non-trivial solution, and even if I skip any, I try to at least add a note about it. I also try to explain every solution in as much detail as I can with comments and docstrings; this is not just a simple code dump.

Currently most of the solutions are from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), but I may add sultions from other programming platforms in the future. 

Feel free to add solutions of your own, even from different platforms or programming languages. You can add links of the problems to their original source, but do not add the problem statement to this repository to prevent copyright issues.
